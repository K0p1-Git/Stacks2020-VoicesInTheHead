#### <u>Introduction</u>

Voices in the head is a 2000 point forensic challenge. Along with the challenge text and an audio file named `forensic-challenge-2.wav` a hint was distributed to all teams as a starting point.

------

#### <u>Solution</u>

The first thing we did was to opened up the wav file and check out what the content. We were immediately rewarded with a loud deafening sound of what seems like bird chirping early in the morning... üòÖ

Now based off our limited CTF experience with the forensic challenges ü§î , usually when a audio file is involved, it usually means steganography of some sort. We pulled out the trusty `Sonic Visualiser` tool and added Spectrogram to the mix ... lo and behold ***let there be magic‚ú®***

There you go, we actually found something. The text extracted from the audio reads `aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXN0ZWJpbi5jb20vakVUajJ1VWI=`. Notice the equal sign at the back of this string ?  Based on past experience in CTFs ü§î, that is a tell tale sign which indicates that this string is `base64 encoded`. To decode this, we simply head over to <a href="www.base64decode.org ">www.base64decode</a> and decoded our string.

A Paste Bin link ? alright so let us go check it out ...

Oh what this? We have seen this before ! Once again, with our limited CTF experience, we have come across challenges is the past that uses this weird programming language / syntax, that's the language `Brain Fuck !!` ü§î 



Now if you never seen this before, you can easily copy and paste the symbols to our trusty friend ***Google*** to find out what the symbols meant, that's how we came to learn about this weird programming language / syntax in the first place! 



So to decode this, we can use <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language">https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language</a> to decode the message:

</p>
<br>


What?! After decoding the message we got the string `thisisnottheflag` ü§¨ did the challenge just pulled one on us ? At this point we were quite lost, seeing how all of what we did lead to no where ...



But a light bulb üí° moment came and we realised we have not touched the initial hint that was provided ! `Xiao wants to help. Will you let him help you?`  Who is this Xiao, and why would he want to help us ? ***Find out more on the next episode of Dragon Ball-Z*** ... (we ended up just Googling it)



Based on the hint we came across a tool called <a href="https://xiao-steganography.en.softonic.com/">Xiao¬†Steganography</a> which seems to fit what we are doing. Another steganography tool ü§î

Running it against our wav file, it seems that a ZIP was detected!! We clicked to open up the zip file ... and we got an error ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what ?

</p>
<br>


We checked throw the zip file into <a href="https://www.x-ways.net/winhex/">WinHex</a> and discovered that the magic numbers were all messed up, is this a broken zip challenge or ?


<br>

</p>
<br>


We can see the magic numbers are all off ? but not only that, it seems like the whole zip is messed up ? Maybe its not a broken ZIP challenge after all ... now what ? üôÉ

Wait a minute ... could it be password protected ? ***Its at this moment another light bulb appearedüí°***

Earlier on when we decoded the base 64 string, where we thought we got trolled, the string `thisisnottheflag`!!

**It is not the flag, its the password for this tool !** ü§Øü§Ø

<br>


With that we got the ZIP file, a proper ZIP file now. Clicking on it now prompts us for another password  ? what the ... ü§¨


<br>

<i>Proper Zip file but still asking for password !!!</i>
</p>
<br>


At this point we thought that it might not actually be encrypted? Like those classic broken ZIP file challenges, so we threw this new ZIP into <a href="https://www.x-ways.net/winhex/">WinHex</a> and WOAH we found the flag (or so we thought... trolled once again üò≠üò≠üò≠)

<br>


We submitted the "flag" `govtech-csg{Th1sisn0ty3tthefl@g}` to the challenge flag and well its fake ...

But wait ... "not yet the flag" ? could this actually be the password for the ZIP?

And there we go! We solved this challenge, and got a clue to the next challenge üåü

#### <u>Conclusion</u>

Let us close this writeup with some key take away and learning point:

‚úÖ Play lots of CTFs !! As seen through out the writeup, we are generally correct when it comes to our guesses (steganography, base64, brainfuck, etc..) by playing lots of CTFs you will gain new experience which could prove to be useful for future CTFs 

‚úÖ Don't give up, throughout this challenge we faced many road blocks ***BUT we believed*** and we pulled through!

‚úÖ Have fun, honestly we joked a lot about the flags but hey this challenge was actually pretty fun üòâ



Special thanks to the member of team ***Ov3rWr1t3*** for pulling through. To those reading till this point, I hope you find this insightful and happy CTF-ing!
